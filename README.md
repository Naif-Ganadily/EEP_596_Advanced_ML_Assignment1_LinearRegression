# EEP_596_Assignment1

This repository contains Programming Assignment 1 for the course EE P 596: Advanced Introduction to Machine Learning, due January 14th, 2023, by 11:59 PM. The assignment, instructed by Prof. Karthik Mohan, focuses on implementing linear regression to analyze two different datasets: Cellphone dataset and a Housing dataset. Student: Naif A Ganadily, TA: Ayush Singh, Grader: Fatwir SM.

The Cellphone dataset analysis includes cleaning and preprocessing the data, data visualization, correlation analysis, and employing machine learning algorithms such as linear regression to predict cellphone prices based on their specifications.

The Housing dataset analysis involves predicting house sale prices in Ames, Iowa, based on various features. The project includes data preprocessing, cleaning, visualization, correlation analysis, linear regression, Lasso regression, model evaluation, feature importance analysis, importance visualization, and model tuning.

The repository contains Jupyter notebooks with complete analysis and code for both datasets. Python, Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn libraries are used for data processing and machine learning implementation. Instructions on running the code on the VS Code server are also included.
